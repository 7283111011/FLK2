    "question": "A burglary takes place at a jewellery shop in the early hours of the morning. The police were called to the incident by the manager of a bar which is situated opposite the jewellery shop ten metres away. The manager of the bar viewed the burglary via the bar\u2019s closed circuit television (CCTV) system, however no recording of the burglary is available because the CCTV system was faulty. The manager gave a statement to the police indicating that, despite the poor street lighting, he recognised the offender as a man who used to work in the bar until one year ago. He names the man to the police. The man, who has previous convictions for burglary, is arrested by the police. In his police interview under caution, the man agrees that he used to work in the bar, but denies that he committed the burglary. The police are considering whether to hold an identification procedure.  Would an identification procedure serve a useful purpose in this case?",

      "D": "No, because the lighting at the time of the offence was poor.",

The LLP provides financial and other services to the families of children with a disability. In her role, the solicitor will provide information and advice about appropriate provision for children with a disability in their parents\u2019 wills. She will also draft documentation on behalf of parents but will not be carrying out any reserved legal activities. The solicitor asks that the name of the LLP be changed to include the word \u2018solicitors\u2019 before she becomes a member. The LLP is reluctant to change its name as the legal work will only account for less than a quarter of its revenue and asks whether this is a requirement under the SRA Code of Conduct for Solicitors, RELs, RFLs and RSLs (\u2018the Code\u2019). Can the solicitor insist that the name of the LLP be changed on the basis that it is a requirement under the Code?",

    "question": "A man is arrested for burglary. He requests his usual solicitor to represent him, but the solicitor is not available. The man agrees to be interviewed under caution (\u2018the Interview\u2019) without legal representation. The man admits the burglary during the Interview and is charged with the burglary. He subsequently instructs his usual solicitor and pleads not guilty at court. The man tells his solicitor that he only admitted the burglary during the Interview because the interviewing officer told him that the evidence against him is stronger than it is. The interviewing officer also said that the man was more likely to be granted bail by the custody officer if he admitted the offence. The solicitor considers whether an application can be made to exclude the man\u2019s confession in the Interview from evidence in his trial. The solicitor considers making an application under s.76 PACE 1984 on the basis that the confession was obtained as a result of the interviewing officer\u2019s statements which were likely, in the circumstances existing at the time, to render any confession made by the man unreliable. If the application is made, which of the following best describes who, if anyone, would bear the burden of proof and to what standard?",
    "options": {
      "A": "The prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the confession was not obtained as alleged in order for the confession to be admitted in evidence.",

    "question": "A solicitor is acting in the administration of an estate. One of the beneficiaries is entitled to a legacy of \u00a310,000 under the terms of the will. The beneficiary would like to use the legacy to pay the fees for a course of study due to start in a month\u2019s time. The solicitor has advised that the legacy will be paid in six months\u2019 time. The beneficiary\u2019s aunt offers to lend the beneficiary \u00a310,000 now but wants to be repaid from the beneficiary\u2019s legacy. The aunt asks the solicitor to agree to send the money for the beneficiary\u2019s legacy directly to her. The beneficiary agrees with the arrangement and at his request, the solicitor writes to the aunt confirming that the solicitor will pay \u00a310,000 to her in six months\u2019 time. Two months later, a codicil to the will is located. The solicitor overlooked the codicil when he searched the papers his firm held on behalf of the deceased. The codicil revokes the beneficiary\u2019s legacy and the beneficiary has no entitlement to any money from the estate. The aunt insists that the solicitor must pay \u00a310,000 to her in four months\u2019 time. The aunt is not a beneficiary under the will or codicil. Is the solicitor bound to pay \u00a310,000 to the aunt?",
