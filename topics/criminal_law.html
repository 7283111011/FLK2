      <h3>Advising Clients at the Police Station</h3>
      <p id="claw-par1">Suspects detained by the police have key rights under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE) and its Codes. They have the right to consult a solicitor in private at any time, and the police must not dissuade them from obtaining legal advice or delay access. A detainee may also request that someone be informed of their arrest, and detention must be periodically reviewed. They are entitled to at least eight continuous hours of rest in every 24‑hour period while in custody. Legal advisers should inform clients of these rights, ensure that interviews are conducted properly and assist vulnerable clients who may require an appropriate adult.</p>

    <!-- Section 2: Identification Procedures -->
    <div class="topic-section" id="claw-sec2">
      <h3>Identification Procedures</h3>
      <p id="claw-par2">PACE Code D governs identification procedures. A formal identification procedure (such as a video identification parade) is generally required where the suspect is not known to the witness. If the witness states that they already know the suspect, a procedure will serve no useful purpose and is not required. Different procedures include video identification, group identifications and confrontations. Police must record reasons for selecting a particular procedure and ensure that the suspect’s solicitor is given notice and an opportunity to attend.</p>

    <div class="topic-section" id="claw-sec3">
      <h3>Interview Procedure and the Right to Silence</h3>
      <p id="claw-par3">During a PACE interview, a solicitor ensures that the suspect understands the caution and advises on whether to answer questions. The right to silence allows a suspect to remain silent, but adverse inferences may be drawn at trial under sections 34–37 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 if questions are not answered without good reason. Solicitors must warn clients of potential adverse inferences and balance this against the benefits of providing an account. Vulnerable clients should have an appropriate adult present and interviews must be conducted fairly; oppressive questioning renders confessions inadmissible under PACE.</p>

      <h3>Bail Applications</h3>
      <p id="claw-par4">Under section 4 of the Bail Act 1976 a person charged with an offence has a general right to bail. Bail may be refused only if specific exceptions apply, such as substantial grounds for believing the defendant would fail to surrender, commit further offences or interfere with witnesses; the court must give reasons for refusal. Conditions may be imposed where necessary to ensure surrender or protect the public. Repeat applications require a change in circumstances. Appeals may be made to a Crown Court judge if bail is refused by magistrates.</p>

      <h3>First Hearings and Plea Before Venue</h3>
      <p id="claw-par5">At the first hearing in the magistrates’ court the defendant is asked to enter a plea. Offences are categorised as summary only, indictable only or either way. For either‑way offences the plea before venue determines whether the case proceeds summarily or is sent to the Crown Court. The court considers the seriousness of the offence and the adequacy of its powers; the defendant can elect Crown Court trial if committed for trial. Representation orders should be obtained where eligibility criteria are met. Failure to appear may lead to a warrant and separate offence.</p>

      <h3>Allocation and Sending to the Crown Court</h3>
      <p id="claw-par6">Either‑way offences are allocated under sections 17A–26 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980. The court must consider representations from the prosecution and defence as to venue and decide whether the offence is suitable for summary trial. Factors include the nature of the offence, the defendant’s record and whether the likely sentence exceeds the magistrates’ powers. Indictable‑only offences and certain linked matters are sent forthwith to the Crown Court under section 51 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. The Sentencing Act 2020 sections 14–20 govern committal for sentence when magistrates lack sufficient powers. </p>

    <div class="topic-section" id="claw-sec7">
      <h3>Case Management and Evidential Rules</h3>
      <p id="claw-par7">Effective case management promotes the fair and efficient conduct of criminal cases. Magistrates’ courts issue case management directions; the Crown Court holds Plea and Trial Preparation Hearings. The Criminal Procedure Rules require early disclosure of prosecution and defence cases and encourage the use of written witness statements. The burden of proof remains on the prosecution to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt. Identification evidence must be treated with caution; the <em>Turnbull</em> guidelines require judges to warn juries of the risks of mistaken identification. Hearsay evidence may be admitted under statutory gateways in the Criminal Justice Act 2003 where the witness is unavailable or for business documents; confession evidence is admissible unless obtained by oppression or in circumstances that render it unreliable (section 76 PACE 1984) and may be excluded under section 78 PACE if admission would have an adverse effect on the fairness of proceedings. Bad character evidence is admissible through gateways in sections 98–101 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 but may be excluded if unfair. </p>

    <div class="topic-section" id="claw-sec8">
      <h3>Trial Procedure and Sentencing</h3>
      <p id="claw-par8">In a criminal trial the prosecution presents its case first, calling witnesses who are examined, cross‑examined and re‑examined. At the close of the prosecution case the defence may submit that there is no case to answer. The defence may then call its own evidence. Solicitors must observe court etiquette, avoid leading questions in examination‑in‑chief and advise on special measures for vulnerable witnesses. Sentencing is governed by statute and the Sentencing Council guidelines. The court considers the seriousness of the offence, aggravating and mitigating factors, and the offender’s culpability. Sentences include custodial sentences, suspended sentences, community orders, fines and discharges. Newton hearings determine disputed facts where a guilty plea has been entered.</p>

      <h3>Appeals and Youth Court Procedure</h3>
      <p id="claw-par9">Decisions of the magistrates’ court may be appealed to the Crown Court against conviction or sentence, or by way of case stated to the High Court on a point of law. Crown Court convictions may be appealed to the Court of Appeal; appellants require leave and must show that the conviction is unsafe or that the sentence was manifestly excessive. The youth court deals with defendants aged 10–17. It has special sentencing powers, including referral orders, youth rehabilitation orders and detention and training orders. Youth offenders jointly charged with adults may appear in adult courts, though the court must consider the welfare of the child. Sentencing guidelines for young people emphasise rehabilitation.</p>
