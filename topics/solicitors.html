      <h3>Client Money and Client Accounts</h3>
      <p id="sol-par1">Client money means money held or received in respect of a client matter. The Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) rules require solicitors to pay client money promptly into a client account and to hold it on trust for the client. Exceptions arise where money is received for fees paid up front or to discharge costs already incurred. Repayment to the client should be made promptly when no longer required. Accurate accounting entries must be made for receipts and payments.</p>

    <div class="topic-section" id="sol-sec2">
      <h3>Client Account Rules</h3>
      <p id="sol-par2">A client account is an account held by a solicitor or firm with a bank or building society specifically designated as a “client account”. Firms must not use the client account to provide banking facilities for clients and must only make withdrawals for the proper purpose of the client matter. Withdrawals must be supported by written authorities and must be recorded promptly in client ledgers. The account should be named to indicate it is a client account and distinguish it from the firm’s own account.</p>

    <div class="topic-section" id="sol-sec3">
      <h3>Segregation of Client Money</h3>
      <p id="sol-par3">Rule 4.1 of the SRA Accounts Rules emphasises the fundamental principle that client money must be kept separate from the solicitor’s own funds. This protects clients’ money and ensures it can be returned on demand. Firms must maintain individual client ledgers and reconcile client accounts regularly. Mixed payments must be allocated promptly, and any residual client balances must be identified and returned.</p>

      <h3>Interest on Client Money</h3>
      <p id="sol-par4">Firms must account to clients for interest on client money if it is fair and reasonable to do so. The firm should have a written interest policy explaining when interest will be paid. Interest received or paid out must be recorded in client ledgers. Interest earned on the client account may be retained by the firm if the firm has provided equivalent or greater interest to the client.</p>

      <h3>Breach of the Accounts Rules and Record Keeping</h3>
      <p id="sol-par5">Breaches of the SRA Accounts Rules must be rectified promptly once discovered. Firms have a duty to investigate the cause of any discrepancies and take corrective action. Detailed records must be kept for each client matter, including ledger entries showing disbursements (using both agency and principal methods), transfers, bills, VAT, and reductions. Regular reconciliations between the client ledger and the client bank account must be carried out, and historic accounting records must be retained for the prescribed period.</p>

      <h3>Joint Accounts, Third‑Party Accounts and Reporting</h3>
      <p id="sol-par6">Joint client accounts may be opened where money is held jointly for two or more clients. A solicitor may also operate a client’s own account with proper authority and safeguards. Third‑party managed accounts are permitted in limited circumstances and must meet SRA conditions. Firms must obtain and deliver an accountant’s report to the SRA annually, unless exempt, and must retain accounting records for the required retention period.</p>
