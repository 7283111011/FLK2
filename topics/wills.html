 <h3>Validity of wills and codicils</h3>
 <p class="subheading"><strong>Testamentary Capacity</strong></p>
 <p id="wills-par1">Under testamentary capacity, the testator must have a sound mind. In other words, they need to understand that they are actually making a will and they have to grasp what that means. They should also know the nature and the value of their assets basically what property or money they own. And finally, they need to understand who may reasonably expect to benefit from their will, such as family members or other dependents.<br><br><strong>Examination focus:</strong> If you get an examination question on testamentary capacity, one key thing to watch out for is whether the testator understood the nature of making a will and the extent of their assets. In other words, in an examination scenario, you may be asked to consider if the person making the will had the mental capacity to understand what they were doing. You will want to look for clues about whether they knew who their beneficiaries were, what kind of property they were leaving behind, and whether they were free from any delusions that may have affected their decisions. If you see a testamentary capacity question, focus on whether the person understood the will, the value of their estate, and their relationships with the beneficiaries.</p>

 <p id="wills-par2">A will may be invalid if it is proven that the testator was under duress or subject to undue influence meaning someone else overpowered their free will and dictated the terms. If there is evidence of coercion or pressure that influenced the testator&#x27;s decisions, the will could be challenged. Essentially, duress and undue influence are factors that can invalidate a will if proven.<br><br><strong>Examination focus:</strong> For a question on duress and undue influence, what you want to focus on is whether the person making the will was pressured or coerced into including certain provisions. In other words, in an examination scenario, you would be looking for signs that someone else exerted undue pressure on the testator, making them include things in the will that they would not have otherwise chosen. you would want to consider whether the testator was acting of their own free will or whether someone else influenced them to benefit themselves. In short, if you see a duress or undue influence question, look for any evidence that the testator&#x27;s freedom to make their own decisions was overridden by someone else.</p>

 <p id="wills-par6">In terms of alterations and amendments to wills, and specifically the effect of changes made before and after the will is executed, here&#x27;s the key point: Any alterations made before the will is signed and witnessed are generally valid as long as they&#x27;re part of the final signed document. On the other hand, if you make changes after the will has already been executed, those changes generally need to be re-executed with the same formalities signed and witnessed again or done through a formal codicil.

In an examination scenario, the key point is whether the changes were made before the will was signed and witnessed or after. If the changes were made before execution, they generally become part of the will as long as the will is properly executed afterward. If the changes are made after the will is executed, then you need to consider whether they were made through a valid codicil, which is an amendment that is formally executed, or if they may invalidate the will if they&#x27;re not done correctly. look for whether the changes were made before or after the will was finalized and whether they meet the formal requirements for amendments</p>

Essentially, it needs to be executed with the same formalities as a will it has to be signed and witnessed like a will would be. in short, a codicil is used to make valid changes or additions to a will, and it has to follow the same signing and witnessing rules to be legally effective.<br><br><strong>Examination focus:</strong> If you get a question about the use of codicils, what you will want to focus on is that a codicil is a formal document used to make an amendment to an existing will without having to rewrite the entire will.

Essentially, a codicil is a way to update a will without starting from scratch, but it still needs to follow all the same formalities to be valid. If you see a codicil question, focus on the formalities and how the codicil modifies the original will.</p>

First, a will can be revoked by creating a new will that explicitly states it revokes the previous one.

 <p id="wills-par9">When it comes to the effect of marriage and divorce on a will, here are the core points. In many jurisdictions, marriage automatically revokes any previously existing will unless that will was made specifically in contemplation of that marriage. On the other hand, divorce does not automatically revoke the entire will, but it usually cancels any gifts or appointments made to the former spouse. Essentially, after a divorce, the will is read as if the former spouse had died before the testator. marriage can revoke a will unless planned for, and divorce typically removes the ex-spouse from the will&#x27;s provisions.<br><br><strong>Examination focus:</strong> If you get an examination question about the effect of marriage and divorce on a will, here&#x27;s what to keep in mind.

In other words, marriage can automatically cancel a previous will. On the other hand, divorce does not automatically revoke the entire will, but it does usually mean that any provisions that included the former spouse are canceled.

 <h3>The interpretation of wills</h3>
 <p class="subheading"><strong>Effect Of Different Types Of Gift</strong></p>
 <p id="wills-par10">when it comes to the interpretation of wills and the effect of different types of gifts, the main point is that gifts in a will can be categorized in different ways, and each type has its own implications. For example, a specific gift is when the will leaves a particular item or a specific piece of property to someone. A general gift is more like leaving a sum of money that is not tied to a specific asset. And a residuary gift is whatever is left over after all other gifts and debts have been taken care of. Each of these types of gifts can affect how the will is interpreted and how the estate is distributed. that is the essence of what you will want to note under that section.<br><br><strong>Examination focus:</strong> If you get a question on the interpretation of wills and the effect of different types of gifts, what you want to focus on is how each type of gift is treated.

 <h3>The interpretation of wills</h3>
 <p class="subheading"><strong>Failure Of Gifts</strong></p>
 <p id="wills-par11">Sometimes gifts in a will don&#x27;t end up being distributed as originally intended. This can happen for a few reasons. For example, the beneficiary may have died before the testator, which is called lapse, or the specific item that was supposed to be given is no longer part of the estate, which is called ademption. In other words, the gift fails if it cannot be carried out for these kinds of reasons, and that is something important to understand when interpreting and applying a will.<br><br><strong>Examination focus:</strong> when you get a question about failure of gifts, what you want to focus on is the reasons why a gift in a will may not be successfully distributed. In an examination scenario, you may see terms like &quot;lapse,&quot; which happens if the beneficiary dies before the testator, or &quot;ademption,&quot; which is when a specific gift no longer exists at the time of the testator&#x27;s death, like if a piece of property was sold before they died. The key point is to identify why the gift has failed and what happens next, for example, whether the gift falls into the residuary estate. If you see a failure of gifts question, focus on the reason the gift didn&#x27;t work out and what the consequences are.</p>

 <p id="wills-par12">Section 46 of the Administration of Estates Act 1925 essentially lays out the order of relatives who inherit when someone dies without a will, which is called dying intestate. The section says that first, the spouse or civil partner will inherit a substantial part of the estate, and if there are no children, they may inherit everything. If there are children, then the estate is divided between the spouse and the children.

In an examination scenario, you will need to know the hierarchy of relatives who are entitled to inherit under intestacy. that usually starts with the spouse or civil partner, then children, and then other relatives if there are no closer heirs. The key point is to understand who inherits and in what order if there is no will. If you see a question on that, think about the intestacy hierarchy and who is entitled to inherit.</p>

This basically means that the inheritance is held in trust according to the rules set out by law. For example, if the beneficiaries are minors, the assets may be held in trust until they reach a certain age.

 <p id="wills-par22">In excepted estate, in more detail, is generally one that falls below a certain value threshold, which in England and Wales is currently £325,000, or where the estate is passing entirely to a spouse or a charity. In those cases, you often don&#x27;t need to submit a full inheritance tax account. Another example of an excepted estate is if the estate has a lower value but is still under the nil-rate band, or if it is a low-value estate that is simply not liable for inheritance tax because it is all passing to an exempt beneficiary. the key point for your notes is that excepted estates are those under the tax threshold or meeting conditions like passing entirely to a spouse or charity, which makes the process simpler and avoids a full inheritance tax form.<br><br><strong>Examination focus:</strong> When you have a question on excepted estates, what you want to focus on is the criteria that make an estate simpler to administer because it falls below a certain value or meets specific conditions. In an examination scenario, you will want to mention that excepted estates are usually those that are under the inheritance tax threshold, or those where the entire estate passes to an exempt beneficiary like a spouse or charity. This means you don&#x27;t have to fill out a full inheritance tax account, and the probate process is simpler. If you see a question on excepted estates, focus on the fact that these are lower-value estates or those meeting specific exemptions, making them easier to deal with.</p>

 <p id="wills-par23">In terms of methods of funding that initial inheritance tax payment, you are right that we want to be thorough. You can indeed ask the deceased&#x27;s bank to pay HMRC directly from their account, which is quite common. Another option is taking out a loan, often called a probate loan or executor&#x27;s loan, which is specifically designed to cover inheritance tax and is then repaid from the estate. Sometimes people may also use their own personal funds if they&#x27;re confident of reimbursement from the estate later.

Once the tax is paid, the remaining estate can be distributed to the beneficiaries.

 <p id="wills-par32">Under the topic of inheritance tax in the context of wills and administration of estates, you will want to understand the difference between lifetime transfers that are immediately chargeable and those that are potentially exempt. Immediately chargeable lifetime transfers (often called CLTs) are typically transfers into most types of trusts. These are chargeable to inheritance tax at the time they are made if they exceed the nil-rate band, which is the tax-free threshold. On the other hand, potentially exempt transfers (or PETs) are usually outright gifts to individuals. These are not immediately subject to inheritance tax at the time they are made. Instead, they only become taxable if the person making the gift dies within seven years of making that gift. If you see a question on this, you will want to focus on whether the lifetime transfer is immediately chargeable (like a transfer into a trust) or potentially exempt (like a gift to an individual) and how that affects when inheritance tax may be due.</p>
